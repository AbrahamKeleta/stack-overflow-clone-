--- Application Documentation --- 

This application is a clone of Stackoverflow with one main difference. When searching in StackOverFlow, the result is a list of posts via popularity. I really appreciated this model because the most relevant posts were on the top. However, in most occasions, the search returns multiple posts that may or may not be the ideal solution for me. In order to find the applicable solution, I have to click on the post on the hope that it will answer my question and redirect to another page. I found that troubling. 

Instead, I wanted to eliminate that extra step and show the solution of the posts in the same page (e.i no redirects). 

In order to do that, I implemented data attributes, click listeners in order to dyanmically change the information.
